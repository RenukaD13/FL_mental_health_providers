#### Motivation
While looking into the mental health data of Florida, it was revealed that the state ranked first in the number of adults experiencing mental illness but 43rd in mental health workforce availability. After researching more, the interesting fact caught my attention which is, Florida’s community mental health system is fully privatized—it contracts with private programs to offer state-funded mental health services. This project aims to explore how a private mental health care provider is positively impacting patient outcomes and improving access to providers and quality resources.

#### Limitations and challenges
The study's descriptive health trajectories are based on data sourced from the private healthcare provider company, Balanced Wellbeing, LLC Florida. The data primarily includes information from nursing homes and assisted living facilities and focuses on elderly patients only, served by the company. The data was provided in 12 seperate excels files for the year 2024. The providers mentioned in the data are employed by company in that month. All the quantative/numeric data posed challenges in drawing conclusions and creating trajectories. Additionally, it is necessary to Mask the sensitive data and actual dataset will not be published along with dashboard.

#### Technologies Used
> - Python / Pandas : for exploration, normalizing and aggregation of the dataset
> - Power BI : for creating interactive dashboard
> - PowerPoint : for introduction of Project
> - Git : for version control
